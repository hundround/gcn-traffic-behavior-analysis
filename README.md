# Traffic Behavior Analysis using Graph Convolutional Networks

This repository is under the documentation requirement for my undergraduate study titled "Traffic Behavior Analysis using Graph Convolutional Networks", a brief overview of the
literature of graph convolutional network (GCN) with respect to the spectral and spatial-based architecture of the method. 

The codes mainly used in this study are adapted from [1] which are _train.py, test.py, dbgcn_utils.py,_ and _gcns.py_. The modified _train.py_ and _dbgcn_utils.py_ can be found under [src/training](https://github.com/hundround/gcn-traffic-behavior-analysis/tree/main/src/training). The remaining GCN codes are unedited and hence
left cited from the [luansen/congestion_propagation_analysis](https://github.com/luansenda/congestion_propagation_inference) repo. The public data used in this study can be found in [zhu/diffusion_attack](https://github.com/LYZ98/diffusion_attack) repo.

(This repository is currently under editing by the author.)
