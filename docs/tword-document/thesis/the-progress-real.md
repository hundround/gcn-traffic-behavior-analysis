`Note 00.`
	hi i dont know what im doing rn. lmao. 
	i am writing this to talk to you. read this and leave a note or two if you fancy.

`Note 01. Dec 06, 2023.`
Presentation with Mam Vicki

Discuss graph-theoric congestion tree process
Discuss data initialization
	a. user inputs
	b. testbed
	c. congestion numerical interpretation
Baseline models vs DBGCN
	a. use either GAN or GCN algorithm to show simple congestion problem analysis
	b. use graph presentations
Conclusion


---
Update 01. 
I already made a congestion network structure learning using R. This is the CTrees???

Update 02. 
I learned about the mathematics behind neural network

Update 03. 
I encoded the Graph-theoric prerequisites for congestion trees

Update 04.
Read Graph Convolutional Network
Read Bayesian Networks

Ahm. 
Discussed CNN.
Discussed GNN.
Difference between CNN and GNN. 
What is GCN. 
How does GCN work in the study.
GNN Toy Problem

Mam pointed out:
1. There are two main ways for the study to progress
	1.1 New input, same methodologies (DBGCN in spatial-based network).
	1.2 Same input, new methodologies (DBGCN in spectral-based network)

`Note 03. Feb 10, 2024.`
I am going to contextualize the dataset and the output of the code. I am going to present it to my adviser. And I am going to introduce what I would like to do with my study. 

Also, I already able to extract the dataset using sheets. Now, it is easier to look at and imitate.
