`Third Meeting. February 27.`

This day we have had a great meeting. We talked about the data and the plans

Data
	1. Choose what road network you are going to understudy.
	2. Then, observe the behavior of the network you are to choose via waze, gmaps, or other road data references.
	3. From this, you need to learn how to make a numpy data that can address and translate these behaviors numerically via (0,1)-valued tensors.
	4. Then, you can start replicating results.

Background
	1. Read the entire chapter of Probabilistic Model, **I. Representation**.
	2. Note of the Dynamic Bayesian Network

Code
	1. Try to understand the code pls. Specifically, the code for R.
	2. Try to understand the code in VSC.
