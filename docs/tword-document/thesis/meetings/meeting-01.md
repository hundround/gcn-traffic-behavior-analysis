`First Meeting. February 20`

We have talked about the data to be used in our study. 
The possible sites to get data from are listed in [[list-of-raw-data-resources]]

Now, the problem with the data we are to find is that it is
(1) hard to find
(2) large sample for small space

What do we aim for the study?
Predict the traffic congestion propagation through series of congestion data in a sample road network. 
	(1) The data serves as the training dataset to capture and model the road network if a congestion happens in it. 
	(2) The output of the model are (a) groundtruth-prediction model of the road network under congestions (b) congestion evolution process per node

We want to have a trained model that will capture the behavior of the road network as it experiences a congestion, recurrent and non-recurrent. This is useful to have a suitable preparation prior to different type of congestions in a busy road network. 

The data are hard to find, as said, given that it requires an accurate raw time-slice dependent velocity data at each moment at each road section.

Now, what we want to do is either
(a) get a simulated data from me yay
(b) get the ever true raw data from MMDA ksksks

Yay this is for next week. 

Also, figure out the code pls.
