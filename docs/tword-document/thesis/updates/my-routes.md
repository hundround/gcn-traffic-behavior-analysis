`Note 01. January 31, 2024.` What should I do?
There's this ideas I've been wanting to be addressed for this study. I am torn between routing with the harder but more rewarding path which is contributing to the theoretical literature of the transportation science or do I go with the easier path which requires me to reframe by exposition the study I am referencing with a local data to use. 

But the more I read the files, the more I am leaning with the harder one. I would like to submit this study to an international journal so as to solidify my name as a part of the academe. That is step one to my aspirations of being a mathematician for society. 

Moreover, I am bringing not only myself in this journey but the people who have helped me put myself in this place where the opportunities are handed with me to use. Not a slightest of hopelessness should foster in me given the situation I am in. 

That is, no holding back for me now. I must do what I should do for them. I am not a Messiah, that I must also understand, but this one in a million chances given to me has to be used to its fullest. 

Ah. 

`NOTE 02. The Route itself??`

Hi. I just wondered that we can progress to this by 
	1. Understanding how npy works. 
	2. Understanding how the algorithm works.
	3. Working with npy, we make our own dataset to be fed in the algorithm.
	4. Now, manipulate the dataset to learn about the whole research study.

`NOTE 03. Literature Significance`

Now that we think of the relevance of the study, we try to incorporate factors that affect traffic aside from its intrinsic data from raw speeds. We try to understand the behavior of the Filipino culture, the climate, the weather conditions, the structure of the road network, the holidays, the politics (maybe??).
